# Thetis_10.29.22
Added new meter control (drop-down) on main console.
Added vac reset function at start, helps stabilize vac sampling - at least for me.
Added values sliders for collapsed view, helps with determining values while in collapsed view.
Added tab in general "options #2" page for "pure signal" form view at startup, also checkbox on "pure signal" main form to allow the "ampview" at startup; either one or both can be slected at startup.
When starting the "multi-meter" window will minimize to allow the new meter for RX1 to move to the "home" position if selected.
